## Motivation
I'm a big fan of [Gary Vaynerchuk](https://garyvaynerchuk.com) and so one day I decided to design some cool wallpapers for my iPhone with inspirational quotes that will remind me to hustle every time I stare at my phone 📱

Now that's poweful! 👊

## Collaborate
I was hosting the wallpapers on a site called [GaryQuotes](https://garyquot.es) (no longer active) but since I wasn't receiving any money 💰 (I know Gary, I know) I decided to create a GitHub repository with all the available wallpapers and make them open source 🙌✨

Cool idea, huh? 😉

So now you can do **whatever you want** with the designs/wallpapers and even collaborate by improving them or adding your own to this repository! 😄
